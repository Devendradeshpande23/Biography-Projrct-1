        <p>Vinayak Damodar Savarkar (pronunciation (help·info), 
            Marathi pronunciation: [ʋinaːjək saːʋəɾkəɾ]; 28 May 1883 – 26 February 1966),
            known among followers by the honorific prefix Veer, was an Indian politician, activist, and writer. 
            He developed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_nationalism#:~:text=Hindu%20nationalism%20has%20been%20collectively,traditions%20of%20the%20Indian%20subcontinent.">Hindu nationalist</a> political ideology of Hindutva while imprisoned at Ratnagiri in 1922.[3][4] 
            He was a leading figure in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_Mahasabha">Hindu Mahasabha.</a>[5]</p> 
        <p>Savarkar joined the Hindu Mahasabha and popularized the term Hindutva (Hinduness),[6] previously coined by Chandranath Basu,[7] to create a collective "Hindu" identity as an essence of Bharat (India).[8][9] Savarkar was an atheist[10] but a pragmatic practitioner of Hindu philosophy.[citation needed]

            Savarkar began his political activities as a high school student and continued to do so at Fergusson College in Pune.[11] He and his brother founded a secret society called Abhinav Bharat Society. When he went to the United Kingdom for his law studies, he involved himself with organizations such as India House and the Free India Society. He also published books advocating complete Indian independence by revolutionary means.[12] One of the books he published called The Indian War of Independence about the Indian Rebellion of 1857 was banned by the British colonial authorities.[13] In 1910, Savarkar was arrested and ordered to be extradited to India for his connections with the revolutionary group India House.
            
            On the voyage back to India, Savarkar staged an attempt to escape and seek asylum in France while the ship was docked in the port of Marseilles. The French port officials however handed him back to the British government in contravention of international law. On return to India, Savarkar was sentenced to two life terms of imprisonment totaling fifty years and was moved to the Cellular Jail in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
            
            After 1937, he started traveling widely, becoming a forceful orator and writer, advocating Hindu political and social unity. In 1938, he was a president of Marathi Sahitya Sammelan in Mumbai. Serving as the president of the Hindu Mahasabha, Savarkar endorsed the idea of India as a Hindu Rashtra (Hindu Nation). He started his militarisation of Hindus from then in order to liberate the country and protect the country and Hindus in the future. Savarkar was openly critical of the decision taken by the Congress working committee in its Wardha session of 1942 to a resolution which said to the British colonial government: "Quit India but keep your armies here", which was intended to defend India against a possible Japanese invasion; Savarkar was opposed to any form of Britain's presence in India whatsoever. In July 1942, as he felt extremely stressed carrying out his duties as the president of Hindu Mahasabha, and as he needed some rest, he resigned from the post, the timing of which coincided with Gandhi's Quit India Movement.[14]
            
            In 1948, Savarkar was charged as a co-conspirator in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi; however, he was acquitted by the court for lack of evidence. Savarkar resurfaced in the popular discourse after the coming of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) into power in 1998[15] and again in 2014 with the Modi-led BJP government at the center.[16]

        <h1>Life and Carrer</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p>Vinayak Damodar Savarkar was born on 28 May 1883 in the Marathi Chitpavan Brahmin Hindu family of Damodar and Radhabai Savarkar in the village of Bhagur, 
            near the city of Nashik, Maharashtra.[17][18] He had three other siblings namely Ganesh, Narayan, and a sister named Maina.[19] When he was 12, he led fellow students in an attack on his village mosque following Hindu-Muslim riots, stating: "We vandalized the mosque to our heart's content."[20][21] In 1903, in Nashik, Savarkar and his older brother Ganesh Savarkar founded the Mitra Mela, an underground revolutionary organization, which became Abhinav Bharat Society in 1906.[22]
            Abhinav Bharat's main objectives were to overthrow British rule and reviving Hindu pride.[23]</p>
            <div id="ArrestInLondonAndMarseille">

        <h2>Arrest in London and Marseille</h2>
        <p>In India, Ganesh Savarkar had organized an armed revolt against the Morley-Minto reforms of 1909.[24]
             The Indian Imperial Police implicated Savarkar in the investigation for allegedly plotting the crime.[25]
              Hoping to evade arrest, Savarkar moved to Bhikaiji Cama's home in Paris.[26]</p>
            </div>
        
        <h2>Case before the Permanent Court of Arbitration</h2>
        <p>Savarkar's arrest at Marseilles caused the French government to protest against the British, arguing that the British could not recover Savarkar unless they took appropriate legal proceedings for his rendition. The dispute came before the Permanent Court of International Arbitration in 1910, and it gave its decision in 1911. The case excited much controversy as was reported widely by the French press, and it considered it involved an interesting international question of the right of asylum.[27]

            The Court held, firstly, that since there was a pattern of collaboration between the two countries regarding the possibility 
            of Savarkar's escape in Marseilles and there was neither force nor fraud in inducing the French authorities to return Savarkar
             to them, the British authorities did not have to hand him back to the French for the latter to hold rendition proceedings. 
             On the other hand, the tribunal also observed that there had been an "irregularity" in Savarkar's arrest and delivery over
              to the Indian Army Military Police guard.[28]
        </p>

        <h2>Trial and sentence</h2>
        <p>Arriving in Bombay, Savarkar was taken to the Yervada Central Jail in Pune. The trial before the special tribunal 
            was started on 10 September 1910.[29] One of the charges on Savarkar was the abetment to murder of Nashik Collector 
            Jackson. The second was waging a conspiracy under Indian penal code 121-A against the King emperor.[30][31] Following
             the two trials, Savarkar, then aged 28, was convicted and sentenced to 50-years imprisonment and transported 
             on 4 July 1911 to the infamous 
            Cellular Jail in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. He was considered by the British government as a political prisoner.[5]</p>
